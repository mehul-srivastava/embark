# Embark

Introducing <strong>Embark</strong>, an open-source learning platform designed to empower developers at every skill level in mastering smart contract development. Whether someone is a complete novice or an experienced programmer, Embark will offer structured levels that guide them through the essential concepts of building smart contracts on the Solana blockchain.

This community-driven initiative aims to position Solana as the premier choice for blockchain development. I will actively welcome contributions — whether it’s creating new learning levels or sublevels—because collaboration is at the heart of this mission.

Our ultimate goal is to simplify the learning journey for anyone looking to dive into smart contract development within the Solana ecosystem.
